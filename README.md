#  Project Euler
Project Euler is a website filled with mathematical programming questions. If you haven't already given their site a look you [should.](https://projecteuler.net/about)

# Why did you make this repo?
This repository exists to contain implementations I create of Euler problems as I attempt to learn different programming language and paradigms.
